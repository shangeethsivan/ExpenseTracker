# Expense Tracker App - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview
The Expense Tracker App is a multi-platform application built with Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform. It allows users to track their expenses, view statistics, and manage their profile information. The app features a modular architecture with separate feature modules for Home, Stats, and Profile screens, accessible through a bottom navigation bar.

## Architecture
The app follows a modular architecture with the following components:
- **Main App Module**: Contains the navigation framework and connects all feature modules
- **Feature Modules**:
  - **Home**: Displays the main expense tracking functionality
  - **Stats**: Shows statistics and reports about user expenses
  - **Profile**: Manages user profile information and settings

## Technical Specifications
- **Platform**: Kotlin Multiplatform (Android and iOS)
- **UI Framework**: Compose Multiplatform
- **Navigation**: Custom bottom navigation with screen switching
- **Module Structure**: Feature-based modularization

## Features and Screens

### 1. Home Screen
- **Purpose**: Main interface for expense tracking
- **Features**:
  - View recent expenses
  - Add new expenses
