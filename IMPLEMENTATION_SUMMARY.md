# Expense Tracker App - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the home page for the Expense Tracker app, which includes:

1. Welcome text on first line
2. Line Graph showing all expenses
3. Money Recipients
4. Transaction history

The implementation follows a clean architecture approach with MVVM pattern and includes a mock network layer with offline support capability.

## Architecture

The implementation follows these architectural patterns:

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with distinct layers
- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel pattern for the presentation layer
- **Repository Pattern**: For data management and coordination
- **Offline-First**: Prioritizes local data with network refresh

## Components Implemented

### Data Layer

1. **Models**:
   - `Expense`: Represents an expense entry with amount and date
   - `Recipient`: Represents a recipient of money
   - `Transaction`: Represents a transaction in the history
   - `HomeData`: Aggregates all data needed for the home screen

2. **Network Layer**:
   - `HomeNetworkDataSource`: Interface for fetching home data from the network
   - `MockHomeNetworkDataSource`: Mock implementation that returns fake data

3. **Local Storage**:
   - `HomeLocalDataSource`: Interface for local data operations
   - `InMemoryHomeLocalDataSource`: In-memory implementation (to be replaced with Room)

4. **Repository**:
   - `HomeRepository`: Coordinates between network and local data sources with offline-first approach

### Presentation Layer

1. **ViewModel**:
   - `HomeViewModel`: Manages UI state and business logic for the home screen

2. **UI Components**:
   - `ExpenseLineChart`: Custom chart component for displaying expense trends
   - `RecipientsList`: Horizontal scrollable list of money recipients
   - `TransactionsList`: Vertical list of transaction history
   - `HomeScreen`: Main screen that composes all components together

3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - `HomeModule`: Simple DI module that provides instances of dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Room Database Integration**:
   - Add Room database implementation for the local data source
   - Create database entities, DAOs, and migrations
   - Update the repository to use the Room implementation

2. **Real Network Layer**:
   - Implement a real network client (e.g., Ktor)
   - Create API service interfaces
   - Add error handling and retry logic

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Add filtering and sorting options for transactions
   - Implement date range selection for the expense chart
   - Add animations and transitions

4. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for the repository and ViewModel
   - Add UI tests for the components

## Conclusion

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the Expense Tracker app with a clean architecture that separates concerns and follows best practices. The mock network layer allows for development and testing without a real backend, and the architecture is designed to easily integrate a Room database for offline support in the future.
